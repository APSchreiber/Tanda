		bio: "Transplants to St. Louis from Arizona and Ohio, Emily Stuart and Andy Schreiber blend together elements of rural American music. Drawing from a catalog of original songs and 19th and 20th century folk standards, the duet weaves together syncopated string rhythms of country-blues guitar with vocal melodies that evoke the hardships and hopefulness of Appalachian Mountain gospel."
